    A new format to LU Squash, giving members the ability to challenge different members of the society, irrespective of dev groups. This provides an ability to communally play squash with a variety of new people. <br/>
    Players are able to move up the ladder, improving their position. They do this through challenging and defeating players in a Best of 1 Game (First to 15 Points). <br/>
    If you successfully challenge, and defeat your opponent, you will move up to your opponent's position, and then will fall down by one position. If you are unsuccessful in your challenge, both players stay at the same position. <br/>
    If you play 3 games, regardless of whether you win or not, you will also move up one place. In the scenario where you play the person above you and you lose, but it is your 3rd game played, then you will still move up one spot. <br/>    
    Try not to organise multiple ladder games as this may cause confusion with the positions of the ladder. Please try to play at least one a week to keep the ladder active. There will be opportunities to play ladder matches during the dev sessions. <br/>
    After your match, please text the LU Squash Group Chat of the result, then we will adjust the ladder. <br/>
    I.e. “Louis Fisher beat Poppy Hall 15-1.”<br/>
    Enjoy! </p>
