    <p>A new format to LU Squash!<br/>
    Record matches by challenging and defeating players in a Best of 1 Game (First to 15 Points). <br/><br></br>
    If you successfully challenge, and defeat your opponent, you will move up to your opponent's position. If you are unsuccessful in your challenge, both players stay in the same position. <br/><br></br>
    When you have played 3 games, regardless of whether you win or lose, you will also move up one place. In the scenario where you play the person above you and you lose, but it is your 3rd game played, then you will still move up one spot! <br/>    
    <br/>Enjoy! </p>
